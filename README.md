# The Eight Elements of Design
## Color (hue)
Color can set the mood or feel of a design. Colors can conjure up associations with words and images. Use the color wheel to choose color harmonies.

## Value (tone)
Value refers to the relative lightness or darkness of color within a composition. Colors can have positive or negative associations, such as pastel colors versus muted colors. Color values can be used to add contrast. Gradation in value can give the illusion of depth, as with glossy, reflective surfaces, drop shadows, and inner glow.
