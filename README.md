# The Eight Elements of Design
## Color (hue)
Color can set the mood or feel of a design. Colors can conjure up associations with words and images. Use the color wheel to choose color harmonies.

## Value (tone)
Value refers to the relative lightness or darkness of color within a composition. Colors can have positive or negative associations, such as pastel colors versus muted colors. Color values can be used to add contrast. Gradation in value can give the illusion of depth, as with glossy, reflective surfaces, drop shadows, and inner glow.

## Texture
Texture can add depth and make a design more visually tactile. Textures can feel rough, smooth, hard, soft, shiny, dull, and glossy. Textures can be made from natural and synthetic materials such as wood, fur, nylon, and vinyl. Some sites that offer textures include Smashing Magazine, TextureKing, Lost and Taken, Texture Mate, Zen Textures, Grunge Textures, and CG Textures. Textures can be use as a focal point or in a subtle way. They can be combined with shapes, lines, colors, lighting, and typography. Textures can also be used as decorative backgrounds in headers, footers, sidebares, navigation bards, buttons, banner ads, and dividers. One of the most popular examples of using texture is to add a sense of depth using a reflective surface.

## Shape
Shapes can set the tone of web graphics. Repeating shapes within a design can help unify all of the elements in a single layout. Shape is any flat area bound by line, outline, value, or color. Shapes can be geometric or organic. Positive shapes can be things such as buttons and navigation bars, while negative shapes are created in the space between two or more forms. Use repeating shapes for your navigation, as decorative embellishment (i.e., ribbon effects), and for the organization of various elements within your design. It could be, for example, a series of thumbnails for news items, or images, or any set of buttons, banners, or widgets.
