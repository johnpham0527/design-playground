# The Eight Elements of Design
## Color (hue)
Color can set the mood or feel of a design. Colors can conjure up associations with words and images. Use the color wheel to choose color harmonies.

## Value (tone)
Value refers to the relative lightness or darkness of color within a composition. Colors can have positive or negative associations, such as pastel colors versus muted colors. Color values can be used to add contrast. Gradation in value can give the illusion of depth, as with glossy, reflective surfaces, drop shadows, and inner glow.

## Texture
Texture can add depth and make a design more visually tactile. Textures can feel rough, smooth, hard, soft, shiny, dull, and glossy. Textures can be made from natural and synthetic materials such as wood, fur, nylon, and vinyl. Some sites that offer textures include Smashing Magazine, TextureKing, Lost and Taken, Texture Mate, Zen Textures, Grunge Textures, and CG Textures. Textures can be use as a focal point or in a subtle way. They can be combined with shapes, lines, colors, lighting, and typography. Textures can also be used as decorative backgrounds in headers, footers, sidebares, navigation bards, buttons, banner ads, and dividers. One of the most popular examples of using texture is to add a sense of depth using a reflective surface.
