## The Eight Elements (Components) of Design
### Color (hue)
Color can set the mood or feel of a design. Colors can conjure up associations with words and images. Use the color wheel to choose color harmonies.

## Value (tone)
Value refers to the relative lightness or darkness of color within a composition. Colors can have positive or negative associations, such as pastel colors versus muted colors. Color values can be used to add contrast. Gradation in value can give the illusion of depth, as with glossy, reflective surfaces, drop shadows, and inner glow.

### Texture
Texture can add depth and make a design more visually tactile. Textures can feel rough, smooth, hard, soft, shiny, dull, and glossy. Textures can be made from natural and synthetic materials such as wood, fur, nylon, and vinyl. Some sites that offer textures include Smashing Magazine, TextureKing, Lost and Taken, Texture Mate, Zen Textures, Grunge Textures, and CG Textures. Textures can be use as a focal point or in a subtle way. They can be combined with shapes, lines, colors, lighting, and typography. Textures can also be used as decorative backgrounds in headers, footers, sidebars, navigation bars, buttons, banner ads, and dividers. One of the most popular examples of using texture is to add a sense of depth using a reflective surface.

### Shape
Shapes can set the tone of web graphics. Repeating shapes within a design can help unify all of the elements in a single layout. Shape is any flat area bound by line, outline, value, or color. Shapes can be geometric or organic. Positive shapes can be things such as buttons and navigation bars, while negative shapes are created in the space between two or more forms. Use repeating shapes for your navigation, as decorative embellishment (i.e., ribbon effects), and for the organization of various elements within your design. It could be, for example, a series of thumbnails for news items, or images, or any set of buttons, banners, or widgets.

### Form
Form is the overall mass of shapes within your design and how they relate to one another. Good form would be a design in which everything in it looks like it is meant to go together, like it has always existed and nothing is out of place. Good form is organized and is interesting to look at. Interactive elements such as sliders, accordions, and other 2D and 3D animation-type effects can be incorporated into form. For a website to use good form, it should have an overall clean, balanced design using interesting interactive features with clearly defined areas of interest. Form is a way to create a balanced, harmonious layout which can include the branding, navigation, images, headlines, text for scanning or skimming, a sidehare with highlights, sections, testimonials, calls to action, and a footer.

### Space (whitespace)
Positive and negative space is created automatically by elements in your design. Space affects the layout's organization and the ease in which a visitor can comprehend and navigate a website. It's important to leave some areas of your design blank. The eye needs a place to rest between and around the elements. Space in the header helps the eye to identify the logo and the navigation. Space can be used in the body such as with a set of thumbnail images. Space helps viewers understand which parts of the design are most important.

### Line
Line can be used to define and enhance shapes within the layout. Line can also be used to set boundaries betweeen objects within a page. Line refers to any actual or implied mark, path, mass, or edge which defines position or direction within the design. Lines can be created in nearly any shape or size. Lines can be curved, undulating, wave-shaped, or even sloping. An edge can create the illusion of line. Lines can also be created by implication, such as by cut-out shapes. Lines can create areas of emphasis, especially when they point to a focal area. For example, adding double lines on either side of an icon can bring focus to that space. Lines can be used as borders, with drokes, and even drop shadows. For example, with a logo, you can add a circle behind it with a stroke effect, with or without a drop shadow. Lines can imply movement by their inherent directionality. For example, adding a diagonal shape to a text box can give it a sense of movement or space, even a little reflection. Lines can be used as dividers to separate sections or areas. Lines can be used for emphasis, such as underlined headers. Use lines thoughtfully to communicate a sense of order and organization with the target audience. Lines can help create natural boundaries that enable viewers to quickly identify key areas within the design.


### Type (typography)
The rigth fonts in the right sizes and colors can help improve readability. and communicate information more effectively. In general, the two main font styles are serif and san serif. People tend to find it easier to read text set in serif fonts. A font with large x-height can improve readability on the web. Terms in typography include ascender, descender, stem, tail, and serif. Leading refers to the space between the baseline of one line of text and the baseline of another. Adjusting the line height can create a more open sense of space within a design.

## The Principles (Rules) of Design
### Order

### Contrast
Contrast can be used to set areas of interest.

### Emphasis
Font styles can be applied to show emphasis.

### Balance
Objects can be aligned to achieve balance.

### Unity
Hyperlink styles can be used to create unity with other text within a design.

### Pattern
Background patterns can help keep a design organized and provide a sense of harmony through the use of repeating elements.

### Movement
Movement can be achieved through various scrolling and animation effects. Line and shapes can also create implied movement.

### Rhythm and Repetition
Rhythm and repetition occurs when one or more elements in a design are repeated often enough to create a visual rhythm. Some degree of variation of repetition works best to combat monotony. For example, widths can be changed or shapes can be varied a little within a repeating set of buttons. Border styles can also be used to add rhythm. Border styles can create a simple rhythm when applied to tables.

### Propotion
Proportion can bring a sense of balance, emphasis, and harmony to a design, and can clue viewers into a design so they know which items are more important than others. Proportion is the visual relationship between two moremore things in terms of their size, number, and degree. Proportion can be thought of as tiered dominance where elements relate to each other in a way that creates a sense of hierarchy and order. Objects can be scaled to achieve proportion.

### Simplicity

### Gradation
